## 👋 About Me
Hi, I'm Lucy, a passionate student currently focusing on creating human-centered digital experiences. I am a 2nd year student studying New Media, Statistics, and Economics at University of Toronto Scarborough, with a deep interest in how design can bridge the gap between technology and people.

My ultimate goal is to design intuitive and aesthetic interfaces that solve real-world problems and improve daily lives. I am always eager to learn new design trends and collaborate on creative projects.
